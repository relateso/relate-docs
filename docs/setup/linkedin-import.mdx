## Overview
Currently, there is no way to automatically migrate or synchronize contact data within the LinkedIn API landscape, so you can export all of your contacts once, import them into Relate, and then sync them periodically thereafter.

## Importing LinkedIn connections

Relate lets you import your LinkedIn connections. Currently, due to the LinkedIn API environment, there is no automatic way to transfer or sync contact data. 

However, you can export all your contacts at once and then import them into Relate. After that, you can periodically sync the data.

### 1. Export your LinkedIn connections

You can also refer to LinkedIn's [official help documentation](https://www.linkedin.com/help/recruiter/answer/a566336/export-connections-from-linkedin).

To export LinkedIn connections:

1. Click the  **Me** icon at the top of your LinkedIn homepage.
2. Select **Settings & Privacy** from the dropdown.
3. Click **Data privacy** on the left pane.
4. Under the **How LinkedIn uses your data** section, click **Get a copy of your data**.
5. Select **Want something in particular? Select the data files you’re most interested in**.
6. Select **Connections**.
7. Click **Request archive**.
8. Enter your password and click **Done**.
9. You'll receive an email to your **Primary Email address** which will include a link where you can download your list of connections.

When exporting your LinkedIn data, there are a few things to keep in mind to make the process a little easier.
- It might take more than 15-20 minutes to get your download link via email depending on the size of the export.
- **When you’re exporting your connection data, you may notice that some of the email addresses are missing. You will only see email addresses for connections who have allowed their connections to see or download their email address.**
- The CSV and vCard formats don't support all characters. As a result, languages with extended character sets (such as Chinese, Japanese, or Hebrew) aren’t supported.
- You currently can't export a list of your contacts that aren’t 1st-degree connections.

### 2. Import data into Relate

Once you have downloaded your LinkedIn connection data, you can proceed to import them into Relate.

<Warning>
**Make sure to check which workspace you are importing your LinkedIn connections data into.**
</Warning>

1. Go to the [Import data page](https://admin.relate.so/workspaces/import_data) in Relate's Admin Console page.
2. Click **Import Organizations**
3. Map each field with the corresponding field in Relate (e.g., First Name, Last Name, Company)
4. Complete the Import process.
5. Check your [Relate app](https://app.relate.so/) to see the imported contacts
