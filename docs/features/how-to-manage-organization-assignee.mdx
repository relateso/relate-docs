## Overview

[Customer Relationship Management (CRM)](https://www.relate.so/blog/what-is-crm/) is a tool that helps you manage customer data. If you're not familiar with CRM tools, you might not know what customer data you need to manage in CRM.

While it can vary by customer type, sales process, and product type, one thing that all teams should manage is Organization Assignee.

In this post, we'll talk about what Organization Assignee is and how to manage it.

## What is Organization Assignee?

Organization Assignee is the person on your team responsible for a customer organization. Assigning specific team members allows them to focus their sales efforts on the customers they're responsible for, and if something comes up or needs to be taken care of, they can quickly find out who to contact and transfer.

Once assigned, everything that happens within the organization is primarily managed by the assignee. Here are some reasons why you should assign an organization.

1. It prevents multiple sales reps from contacting the same customer at the same time.
2. Sales reps can focus on their own customers.
3. It's easy to know who to refer to when something goes wrong with specific customers.

## If you multiple reps on one organization

Depending on the size and roles of your sales team, you might have multiple reps managing a single customer. This might be the case if you have a sales team with a clear role division or if multiple reps need to collaborate on sales activities at the same time.

In this case, you can add a new Custom Field to Organization to assign multiple reps to manage a customer.

In the screenshot above, you can see that Won is the primary assignee, but Chris is a Sales Engineer and supports the technical part of the sales process.

This way, you can assign one or multiple reps to manage customers.
