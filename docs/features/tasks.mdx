## Task Management

You can use the Task feature to manage a variety of to-dos for sales and customer management.  

![task](/docs/images/changelog/task.png)

With Task v1.0, you can manage tasks from the Organization Detail Page (each customer's page). As you can see in the screenshot above, you can see a list of Tasks in the bottom left corner.

In v1.0, you can enter a to-do, assign a responsible person,  set a due date, and mark it as complete when you're done. 

In future updates, you'll be able to receive reminder notifications.
