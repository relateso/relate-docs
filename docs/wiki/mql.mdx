## What is a Marketing Qualified Lead?

A Marketing Qualified Lead (MQL) is a lead you have qualified as a potential buyer through your marketing efforts. MQLs are prospects who have provided information, expressed interest, and met the ICP criteria to move to the next stage of the sales process through your marketing campaign.

Typically, MQLs are customers who have shown interest in your products or services and have requested more information or a demo meeting via email, landing page form, etc.

Like [PQLs (Product Qualified Leads)](https://www.relate.so/docs/wiki/pql), MQLs are typically further qualified by salespeople. Once qualified, MQLs become [SQLs (Sales Qualified Leads)](https://www.relate.so/docs/wiki/sql). SQLs are prospects with potential sales opportunities and require direct contact from the sales team.
