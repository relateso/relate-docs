</Tip>

BANT is a framework the sales team can use to evaluate prospects whether they have budget, authority, needs, and timing.

Budget: Does this prospect have the budget to buy our product?

Authority: Does this prospect have the authority to make a purchase decision without requiring approval from other stakeholders?

Need: What is this prospect's need? Is it a problem that our product can solve?

Timeframe: Is it appropriate to adopt now?

## Champions Can Help You Get the Information You Need.

A champion is a person in a customer organization who best understands the need for your product and works inside the organization on behalf of your sales team. They can tell you about the decision-making process, the goals and concerns of each decision-maker, and what it takes to convince them, which can be difficult for salespeople outside the organization to understand.

The more complex the product, the more expensive the product, and the more difficult it is to sell without a champion. Thus, salespeople need to find champions early in the sales process.
