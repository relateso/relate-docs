## Pipeline Management

![Pipeline Management](/images/features/pipeline-management.png)

You can easily drag & drop each deal card to reflect updates.

### What is Pipeline?

The Deal Pipeline is the source of truth for your sales team's performance. You can see the number of deals and the total value of deals in each status. You can also see the owner of deals and if there are any objections/blockers.

- You can see Deal Progress.

- Sales reps can identify required actions to convert deals to the next steps.

- You can see the total value of deals in each status.

#### Deal - Lead Connection

When you scroll over the upper right corner of a deal card, two buttons appear as shown below. The button on the left allows you to check the deal information in detail, and the button on the right takes you to the lead detail page linked to the deal.

You can also come back to the Deal Pipeline page directly from the Lead Detail Page by clicking the button on the top right corner.

## Add Deals

### What is a Deal?

**A deal is a sales opportunity.** Each deal is counted as a single sales opportunity.

You can create and manage multiple deals for each Lead (Customers).

![What is a deal](/images/features/what-is-deal.png)

When you have multiple deals, it will be shown like this in the Lead Detail Page.

### How to Add Deals

![Adding a deal](/images/features/how-to-add-deals.png)

There are 3 ways to add a deal.

1. On the Deal page, click `+Deal` button on the top menu.

2. You can click the `+` button on the Pipeline Status column. (You won't be able to change the status)

3. On the Lead Detail page, you can click `+` button from the left menu. (You won't be able to change the company/lead)

In the Deal, you can add information such as:

- Company: The name of the lead

- Contact: Main point of contact from the company

- Value: Value of the sales opportunity

- Status: Deal pipeline status

- Assignee: Deal Owner

- Notes: Notes regarding the sales opportunity

Company and Status are the only required fields, and the rest can be left empty.

<Note>

If you go down to the bottom of this page, then you can find information about creating Custom Field for deal cards.

## Manage Deal Status

You can customize deal statuses to fit your team's sales process.

![Manage deal status](/images/features/manage-deal-status.png)

To manage the Deal Status, click Workspace ellipsis (⋅⋅⋅) in the Relate app, and click `Manage deal statuses` from the menu that appears.

![Manage deal statuses](/images/features/manage-deal-statuses.png)

You can change the order by clicking the arrows, and you can change the name of each status by clicking `Edit`.

Click `Delete` to delete the status. However, to delete the status, there must be no Deal in the status.

There are 3 types of Deal Status.

- Active: Active Deal

- Won: Won Deal

- Lost: Lost Deal

<Note>

To check Deal Status modifications reflected immediately, relaunch the Relate app or refresh it by pressing Ctrl+Shift+R (macOS: Cmd+Shift+R) if it is already running.

</Note>

## Deal Filtering

By clicking the `Filter` button at the top right of the Deal Pipeline page, you can apply various filters.

A good example would be to look at the deals managed by each sales rep or look at the new deals created this month. To create this list, you can create a filter as follows.

- `Updated at` \+ `is after` \+ This Monday

![Deal filtering](/images/features/deal-filtering.png)

### Applying Multiple Filters

When applying more than 1 filter, you can apply one of the two conditions: And / Or.

- `And`: Deals that fulfill both Filter A and Filter B.

- `Or`: Deals that fulfill at least one of the Filter A and Filter B.

## Deal Custom Field
