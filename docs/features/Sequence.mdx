## Overview

You can now build multi-day email sequences with Relate Sequence. Relate Sequence Beta is a simple email automation tool designed for B2B startups and is now available to all Relate paid users during beta.

## Beta update

Relate Sequence beta is not yet appropriate for sending large volumes of cold emails but rather for automatically sending follow-up emails to a small batch of customers. For example, you can use Relate Sequence beta for the following purposes:

- You want to automatically follow up a sales opportunity in the pipeline.
- You want to automatically follow up on inbound leads.

## How to use Relate Sequence

- `{{now_month}}`: The current month (e.g., November)
