## Why CAC and LTV are important?
You can check the profitability of your product by considering the LTV:CAC ratio. 
It is ideal when the LTV is greater than the CAC, which means that the revenue you generate from a customer is greater than the cost of acquiring the customer. Therefore, you can still profit with a higher LTV even with a high CAC. On the other hand, if you have a low LTV, you might have low profitability even with a low CAC.
