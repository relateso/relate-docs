Integrating Slack with [Relate](https://www.relate.so/) lets you send real-time notifications for key updates about your [organizations](/features/organizations), [deals](/features/deals), and [notes](features/notes) directly to Slack channels. If you collaborate with your team on Slack while handling your CRM activities in Relate, this integration keeps everything in sync and accessible in one place.

By Integrating Slack with Relate, you can:

- Extend Relate’s functionality by receiving key updates directly in Slack and seamlessly navigating to the source of the notification in Relate.
- Improve team collaboration with instant discussions based on Relate notifications.

## How to Integrate

1. Enter the Relate workspace you want to connect to Slack. You must be an admin of the workspace for initial integration.
2. At the top left of the Relate app, click the workspace name.
3. From the dropdown menu, go to **Manage workspace > Integrations > Slack**. You will be directed to the Slack integration page in your browser.

<Tip>You can also access this page by navigating to **Settings >** **Team notifications** (or simply **Notifications** for personal workspaces), and then clicking `Connect`.</Tip>

4. Click `Connect` to begin the integration process.
5. Choose a Slack workspace to integrate. If you don’t have permissions, request the owner of the workplace for integration.
6. Click `Allow` to grant permission for the integration.
7. Once connected, your Relate workspace and Slack channels will sync, allowing notifications to appear in your designated Slack channels and enabling you to navigate from Slack to the relevant content in Relate.
