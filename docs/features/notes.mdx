## Overview
Create, edit, and share notes with your team for each Organization. You can also create templates to format your notes automatically.

## Basics
One of the best and easiest ways to improve your sales is always writing notes after each sales call.

Notes in Relate supports markdown syntax and you can also use WYSIWYG styling button located at the top of each draft.

### Creating a note
To create a note, go to an Organization detail page. Then, click `Create note` to open new draft.

Alternatively, you can create notes directly from your Inbox or any of your Deal pages (e.g., Prospect, Pipeline).

<Warning>Currently notes do NOT save as a draft.</Warning>

### Templates
To use a template for repeat formats, hit `Use template` after opening a new draft.

Relate has three prebuilt templates - Default, [BANT](https://www.relate.so/blog/what-is-bant/), and [MEDDIC](https://www.relate.so/blog/what-is-meddic/).

You can create a new template by clicking `+ Add a new template`.
