## Overview

Here's how to export data stored in Relate as a .CSV file. You can export data using the Basic Table in the Reporting page. 

## Deal Export
If you want to export deal information, you can download from the [Reporting page](https://app.relate.so/reporting).

Deal exports include the following information:
- All information contained in the deal card (including custom fields)
- Organization and contact data associated with the deal card (including custom fields)

In the Reporting page, you can create a new Basic Table to add the information you want to export. You can then save it as a CSV file to download.

## Organization & Contact Export
You can export Organization and People information the same way you export deals. Just replace the data set with Organization or Contact.
