## Overview
Create, edit, and share notes with your team for each Organization. You can also create templates to format your notes automatically.

## Basics
One of the best and easiest ways to improve your sales is always writing notes after each sales call.

Notes in Relate supports markdown syntax and you can also use WYSIWYG styling button located at the top of each draft.

### Creating a note
There are multiple ways to create notes -- the easiest way is by navigating to `Notes`. 

![Notes-menu](/images/features/note-menu.png)

The note section on the left navigation menu allows you to create and manage note templates. In the future, you can track all of your drafts here. 

Also, you can go to an Organization detail page. Then, click `Create note` to open new draft.

Alternatively, you can create notes directly from your Inbox or any of your Deal pages (e.g., Prospect, Pipeline).

<Warning>Currently notes do NOT save as a draft.</Warning>

### Templates
To use a template for repeat formats, hit `Use template` after opening a new draft.

Relate has three prebuilt templates - Default, [BANT](https://www.relate.so/blog/what-is-bant/), and [MEDDIC](https://www.relate.so/blog/what-is-meddic/).

You can create a new template by clicking `+ Add a new template`.

### Get AI Suggestions
![note4](/images/features/ai-suggestion-suggestion.png)
Get AI suggestions for field values based on what you write in your note, and easily fill in fields with a single click.

1. When you finish writing a note, the AI Suggestions section appears between the note and comments. This is where you can apply the values you need.
2. If you want to get suggestions from past notes you've already created, select the `...` button to the right of the note > `Suggest fields with AI`. However, you can only get suggestions once.

For more information on how to use AI Suggestions, see the [AI Suggestions guide](/features/ai-suggestions).
