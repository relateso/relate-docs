## Overview
An Organization is one of the core concepts in Relate, representing an entity that you're building relationships with and engaging in a deal. An Organization can be a prospect, current customer, lost customer, and/or churned customer.

## Concepts

### Organization Details page

![odp](/images/features/org-detail-page.png)

The Organization Details page collects all information and data linked to the organization you're tracking.

This includes organization data, deals, people, tasks, email history, notes, comments, and activities history.

### Organization Grid

The Organization Grid is a list view of all organization in your Workspace. In the grid, you can update each field by selecting and double clicking (or hitting `Return`) the field.

To view detailed information about a specific organization, click `Open` located on each organization.

    position: "relative",

  While creating a new Organization, you can also create a Person associated with the organization. Click `+ Add contact data` located at the bottom of the modal.

### Automatically add an Organization when adding a Contact
When adding a [Contact](/features/people), the system automatically assigns the contact to an Organization based on the domain of their email address, even if you don't manually enter the organization's name.

### Edit Organization fields
You can update an Organization field by navigating to Organization Grid or you can double click a field in the Detail page as well.
