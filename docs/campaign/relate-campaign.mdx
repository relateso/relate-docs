## Using email editor

You can apply different styles to your text using the toolbar at the top of the email editor. 

You can also add images, resize images, and change alignment.

Finally, you can add call-to-action (CTA) elements using buttons. Adding a link allows you to see if the link is clicked when measuring campaign performance.  

## Sender identity management and sending emails

### Sender identity management

After you compose your email, you can edit the sender's identity information before you send it. 

You can set the sender's email address, name, and email address to receive replies. 

### Sending emails

Before sending an email, you need to select an audience. You can do this by selecting a list under `Audience.` 

You can send emails to the prospects and customers you manage with the Relate List feature at once. 

Once you've selected the list to which you want to send the email, you can choose to send it immediately or schedule it for a specific time in the future. 

If you want to test the email first to ensure it goes out as intended when you actually send it, you can click `Test send` in the top right corner to send a test email to yourself or a team member. 

## Measuring email campaign performance

- Number of emails sent
- Campaign overall open rate, click-through rate, and unsubscribes
- Delivery status, email opens, clicks, and unsubscribes by recipient
