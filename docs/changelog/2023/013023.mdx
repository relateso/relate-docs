## Simple task management

![task](/docs/images/changelog/task.png)

 You can now use simple task management to track sales and customer-related tasks in Relate directly.

 Our first version of task management features an easy way to list all your customer/sales-related tasks on each organization page. You can assign a person and check/uncheck each item.

## [Re-installation required] Install to update application no longer required
 We've migrated to a new deployment system, which allows you to skip the entire uninstall/reinstall newly updated version every time we deploy.

 This update will be your LAST manual update and moving on, all updates will be downloaded and applied automatically. Please follow the below steps to proceed:
 1. Remove the current version of Relate from your desktop
 2. Go to this [download page](https://download.relate.so/) to download the latest Relate version and install.
 3. All future upgrades and updates will be applied automatically.

 <Warning>If you install the newest version without removing your current legacy Relate version, you might end up with two different Relate applications on your desktop!</Warning>

 <Warning>If your current Relate version is NOT 0.14.0, please update it to 0.14.0 first, and then proceed with above steps.</Warning>

## Download email file attachments
