## Overview
Product-Led-Growth and Product-Led-Sales are growth strategies that attract prospects, deliver values, and make sales through a product with no or minimal sales team involvement. 

Prospects that are validated as having a greater sales opportunity through the product are called [Product Qualified Leads](https://www.relate.so/docs/wiki/pql).  

## What is product-led-growth(PLG)?
PLG is a growth strategy where your product plays a key role in customer acquisition and revenue growth. It's what gets prospects to find your product, use the product, and buy it without sales team's support. That's why it's so important to deliver value through the product and great user experience in PLG. 

It's a growth strategy that is very different from the traditional sales-led-growth(SLG) strategy, where the sales team plays a key role in revenue growth. 

## What is product-led-sales(PLS)?
PLS is a growth strategy very similar to PLG, but with the addition of the active involvement of the sales team. The sales team utilizes product usage data to find [champions](https://www.relate.so/docs/wiki/champion/) and determine the best time to contact prospects.
