## Overview

Here's how you can export data stored in Relate to a .CSV.

## People Export
The easiest way to export customer information in Relate is from the People list. 

The People list contains the following information:
- Person Name
- Title
- Person Email
- Phone Number
- Organization Name
- Person Custom Fields

You can download the People list by clicking `Download Emails as CSV` in [People List View](https://app.relate.so/contacts).

## Deal Export
If you want to export deal information, you can download from the [Reporting page](https://app.relate.so/reporting).

Deal exports include the following information:
- All information contained in the deal card (including custom fields)
- Organization Nme, Website, Description, Domain, Created At, Updated At, Last Contacted At
- Contact Name, Title, Email, Phone, Created At

In the Reporting page, you can create a new Basic Table to add the information you want to export. You can then save it as a CSV file to download.
