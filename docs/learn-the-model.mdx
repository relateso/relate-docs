## Basic concepts
Relate is a multi-workspace (and multi-user) CRM and each **workspace** has its own set of [Organizations](/features/organizations), [People](/features/people), [Deals](/features/deals), [Process](/features/processes), and [List](/features/lists).

### Organizations/People
An organization is a company that you are working with. They can be a prospect (lead), customer, or previous customers.

A person (people) is part of the organization. They are "contacts" which store information such as names, email addresses, phone numbers, titles, positions, etc.

### Deals/Pipeline
**Deals are the core means to track sales in Relate**. Every other concepts such as Organization and People are *connected* to deals and they represent *who* you're engaging with in a deal.

As such, each deal represents a sales opportunity. So you can have multiple deals within an organization.

Note that deals are always tied to an organization. 

Deals have ID (e.g., `DEAL-1234`) - this makes it easier to discuss a specific deal with your team and easier to reference.

Lastly, each deal follows a prospect status and once a deal gets marked as `Qualified` then it is automatically added to the pipeline for closing.

<Tip>Currently, you can create a deal directly from the pipeline as well. This will automatically mark it as `Qualified`, ready for closing in the pipeline.</Tip>

See below diagram for reference.

#### Prospect
A prospect is a sales opportunity that is not qualified yet. Sales teams work to qualify the prospect.

Updating prospect status for a deal will move the deal to the respective status list shown in the left navigation menu.

Prospects can have any of below statuses:
- Potential
- Working
- Nurturing
- Bad Fit
- Qualified

Once qualified, the prospect then automatically turns into a closing deal in the pipeline.

To learn more about Prospect feature, see this [guide](/features/prospect).

#### Closing Pipeline
As you work towards closing a sales opportunity, each deal will move through pipelines. 

A pipeline is a place where you will actively engage with the customer to close the deal.

You can see more details about the deal (and customer) by clicking each deal card in the pipeline.

<Info>

In summary, Relate's concepts can be listed as:

- Organization = Companies you are selling to. They can be both prospects and current/lost customers
- Person = People that work for the companies you're selling to.
- Deal = Sales opportunity

</Info>

### Process
It provides process to help you organize not only Prospecting and Pipeline, but also various workflows.

In addition to the sales status that was previously managed in Deals/Pipeline, you can manage and track all tasks that have a process, such as Fundraising, Recruiting, and more.

These processes can be created more conveniently and quickly with templates.
![process](/images/features/process-process.png)

To make it easier to discuss and manage when you need to discuss a specific [Entry](/features/processes#1-entry) with your sales team, each entry has an assigned Identifier (e.g. OPS-52).

By default, the Identifier is given based on the template you chose when you created the process, but you can change it to anything you want through the settings.

Finally, you can manage different Processes by connecting them in Settings > Process > General > Connected lists. 
(You can find a detailed explanation in [Connecting Processes](/features/processes#connecting-process)).

### List
Lists are customer lists that help you segment and manage your customers based on their purpose.

You can create lists with any categorization you want, whether they are prospects, current customers, or former customers.

As an example, in Relate, you must select a Contact list as the recipient list to send [Campaigns](/marketing/campaigns), which allows you to create a list of targeted campaign senders and manage them on an ongoing basis.
