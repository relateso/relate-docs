## Overview
You can now let your prospects and customers book meetings with you in seconds via Relate Meetings.

## Getting Started with Relate Meetings

### 1. Calendar Integration
To use Relate Meetings, it **must be integrated with one of the following calendars: Google, Outlook, or Apple Calendar**. **Only times with no pre-scheduled appointments will be automatically shown**, so you can leave meeting slots open without worrying about schedule conflicts.

The integration process is as follows:
1. Go to the workspace name in the top left corner of the screen > Settings (You can also use the shortcut cmd + , or ctrl + , to navigate).
2. Click on Meetings > Calendars at the bottom of the left sidebar.
3. Click the `+ Add` button and select the calendar you wish to integrate (Google, Outlook, Apple, etc.).
4. Select your calendar account and allow access to Cal.com. Cal.com is a platform that automatically coordinates schedules with external users and is embedded in Relate, so you can use it right away without a separate signup.

  Once the integration is complete, the connected calendar account will be displayed as shown in the image below.

### 2. Default Settings
After connecting your calendar, go to the in-app settings page (cmd + , or ctrl + ,) and go to Meetings in the bottom left corner. 

#### 2-1. Select Calendar
![cal-setting1](/images/features/cal-settings1.png)

First, select which of the linked calendars you want to add the schedule that was created through Relate Meetings to. 

![cal-setting2](/images/features/cal-settings2.png)

To avoid double bookings, select a calendar to check for conflicts.

#### 2-2. Manage Availability
Availability is about setting the available time slots for each user (account).

To set the available times, press + Availability, then enter a name, and a window will pop up where you can set the times.
![cal-setting3](/images/features/cal-availability-setting.png)
Use the toggle button to select whether to allow meetings by day of the week.

If the toggle button is on, set the time range for meetings to be scheduled on that day of the week. You can also set the time zone by city in Timezone on the right.

When you're done, select Save to save your settings.

If you turned on the Set to Default setting, the availability will be set as the default and will be automatically assigned and displayed when creating a meeting scheduler.

![cal-setting4](/images/features/cal-settings3.png)
You don't necessarily have to have only one availability, you can create and manage multiple availability as needed.

Depending on the nature of your meeting, you can create different availabilities and then select the desired availability when creating a meeting schedule.

![cal-setting3](/images/features/cal-settings3.png)

Next, you can set your availability. You can also set the time zone in the Timezone field on the right. 

The availability set here is the default availability for each account. It will be updated in the future so that you can create and manage various availability. 
 

#### 2-3. Configuring Conferencing Apps
![cal-setting4](/images/features/cal-settings4.png)

Finally, you can select which app to use for a video conferencing.

The default setting is Cal.com app. You can use Google Meet, Zoom, and MS Teams Video. 

## Creating a meeting scheduler 
Select the Meetings tab on the left side of the Relate menu. 

Next, click the '+ Meeting scheduler' button at the top to open the pop-up window shown below.

![cal2](/images/features/c2.png)

Title is the name of the meeting scheduler that is displayed within the Relate app. 

Slug is added at the end of the meeting link and is automatically created based on the Title, but can be modified. 

Assignment can be selected appropriately according to the type of meeting scheduler. 
- Collective: Allows all selected hosts to schedule meetings only when they are available at the same time. This is generally used for group calls. 
- Round Robin: This calendar rotates between multiple hosts each time a prospect schedules a meeting. Each host can get equal number of meetings, or you can maximize availability.
- Managed Event: This can be used for a personal calendar for 1:1 meetings. 

<Note>
**Cautions for selecting a Managed Event**

If you created a meeting scheduler with Managed Event, it shows meeting links for all assigned hosts.

This is because if another team member copies and shares a link from a Managed Event meeting scheduler created by another team member, it will be an invalid URL.
![cal-managed](/images/features/cal-managed-event.png)
For example, a Managed Event meeting scheduler link created by Chris is only valid when copied by Chris, and cannot be accessed normally if copied by Won.

Therefore, if you want multiple people to share a single Managed Event, you need to assign the people you want to share it with and copy their links.
</Note>

### Event Setup

### Assignment
![cal-assignment](/images/features/cal-assignment.png)

You can manage event hosts in this page. 

For a personal calendar, you can select yourself. 

For Round Robin, you can make the following settings. 
- Distribution: Maximize availability, which provides as many meeting slots as possible, or load balancing, which allocates meeting slots in a fixed ratio.
- Fixed Hosts: Hosts who must participate in all meetings.
- Round-Robin Hosts: Add hosts from your team, then set their priority (the higher the priority, the more meetings they will be scheduled for) and weights (with the same ratio resulting in the same number of meetings).
