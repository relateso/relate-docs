## Overview
Unlike the sales process, the Simple sales process is a template that combines Prospects and Pipeline into one.
Like the sales process, it offers Contact as a custom field so that you can specify the contacts you need in the sales process.

We've simplified it by omitting some of the statuses in Prospects, leaving only the statuses in Pipeline, so that you can track all of your sales in one process.

<Note>
    You can learn more about using processes in [What is Processes?] (/process/process).
</Note>

<Info>
    If you want to change the status and custom fields provided by this template,
    
    you can find instructions in [What is Processes > 3. Setting up the process](/process/process#3) and the [Custom Fields Guide](/features/custom-fields).
</Info>

## Basics
Prospects created using the Sales process template have a total of five different statuses. ([Learn more about Prospects status](/process/sales#prospect-status))

- **Potential** (What Simple sales process offers)
- Working
- Nurturing
- Qualified
- Bad Fit

However, in a simple sales process, we only provide **Potential**, and the rest consists of the status of the pipeline that tracks the deal process, as shown below.
- Meeting scheduled
- Closing
- Closed Won
- Closed Lost

Also, as with the Sales process, you can provide Contact as a custom field to specify the contacts needed in the sales process.
