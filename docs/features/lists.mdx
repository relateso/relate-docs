## Overview
Lists feature allows you to organize and segment your Organizations and Contacts into targeted groups for campaign emails or sales workflows.
For example, you can create separate lists for prospects and existing customers, or group potential clients by industry to send personalized content tailored to each segment.
What You Can Do with Lists
With Lists, you can segment your customer base and manage tailored email communications or sales processes accordingly.

There are two types of lists you can create:
- **Organization-based lists**
- **Contact-based lists**

Here’s how Lists can be used:
1. Select a list as the recipient group for **One-off Campaigns** or **Triggered Campaigns**.

## FAQs
### Q. How is Lists different from Views?
**A. Views** lets you apply and save filters on your existing Organizations or Contacts, for example, to only show entries with “AI” in the name.
Lists, on the other hand, saves the filtered results into a standalone group of Organizations or Contacts. This saved list can then be used for sending emails or managing through Processes.
### Q. I want to download a List as an Excel file.
**A.** Go to **[Reporting]** → **[Add View]** → Select **List Contact Entries** for Data set → Select **Basic Table** for View, and select the columns you want to include.

### Q. I want to turn selected recipients from an email campaign into a list, and immediately add them to a pipeline built for Organizations.
**A.** Currently, each entries can only be added to Lists and Processes of the same type—Organization to Organization or Contact to Contact.

However, if you select a process entry of an organization, you can add its associated contacts to a Contact-based List.

The reverse—adding entries from a Contact List to an Organization-based list or Process—will be available in a future update. Stay tuned!
