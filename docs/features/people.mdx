## Overview

People can either belong to an [Organization](/features/organizations/) or exist independently. "People" can be your customers, any stakeholder involved in the customerâ€™s purchasing process, such as company representatives, decision-makers (champions), or procurement managers.

## Concepts

### People Grid
The People Grid is a list view of all people records in your Workspace. In the grid, you can update each field by selecting and double clicking (or hitting `Return`) the field.

To open the Organization Details page associated with a person, click the `Open` button.

## Add a Person
There are multiple ways to add a new Person:

- Click `+Contact` in the People Grid to add a new person.

- In the Organization Details page, click the `+` button in the **Contacts** section.

- When adding a new Organiztion, click `Add contact data` located at the bottom of the modal.

<Tip>
  While creating a new Contact, the system automatically assigns the contact to an [Organization](/features/organizations) based on the domain of their email address, even if you don't manually enter the organization's name.
