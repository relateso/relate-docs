## Overview

You can now send repetitive emails automatically with Relate Sequence. Relate Sequence Beta is an email automation tool like Apollo.io and is available to Relate paid customers right now.

## Caution

Relate Sequence beta is not yet appropriate for sending large volumes of cold emails but rather for automatically sending follow-up emails to a small number of customers. For example, you can use Relate Sequence beta for the following purposes:

- Follow-up emails to customers who are in the pipeline.
- Follow-up emails to schedule meetings with inbound leads.

Since you can't add multiple prospects to a sequence and you can't select different email addresses to use, Relate Sequence Beta isn't ideal for sending large volumes of cold emails. If you send large volumes of cold emails with your main email address, there's a high chance of damaging your domain reputation. For best practices on cold emailing, check out the Relate Blog.
