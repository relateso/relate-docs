## How to install

- We currently support macOS, Windows, and Linux OS

### Log into Relate within Extension

To automatically add the extracted data to Relate, choose the workspace you want to add data to, and click `Add to Relate`.


## Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ)
<AccordionGroup>
<Accordion title="Why isn't email address showing up for some profile pages?">
If the profile owner chose to hide their email address, the extension will not be able to extract the email address.

Generally, if you are a 1st degree connection with the profile owner, you'll be able to see their contact information. For 2nd or 3rd degree connections, the profile owner needs to make their contact information publicly available.
