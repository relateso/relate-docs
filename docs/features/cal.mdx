## Overview
You can now let your prospects and customers book meetings with you in seconds via Relate Cal beta.

## Relate Cal beta

To get started using Relate Cal, find the Meetings (beta) tab on the left main navigation menu.

Relate Cal currently supports:
- Create multiple meeting schedulers for various use-cases
- Add multiple calendars to meetings (for round-robin)
- Customize event title, duration, booking flow, opening hours, url, forms, styles, etc.
- Share via links

### Calendar Types
- Single host: This calendar has only one host. Single host calendars should be used for 1:1 meetings and calls with your prospects or customers.
- Round-robin: This calendar rotates between multiple hosts each time a prospect schedules  a meeting. Each host gets equal number of meetings. This is best suitable for general inbound discovery meetings and/or customer follow up meetings.
- Round-robin + Maximize Availability: This calendar maximizes availability for the prospect to schedule a meeting. So, some hosts may get more bookings than the other depending on their availability.
