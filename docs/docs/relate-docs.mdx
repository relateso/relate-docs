## Overview
With [Relate Docs](https://www.relate.so/products/docs), you can now conveniently share documents as links and quickly and easily track whether they've been viewed by others.

Relate Docs is a document tracking tool, like DocSend and SalesClue, that allows companies to maintain access control when sharing internal documents externally.

## How it works
After signing up and logging in to Relate, click Documents at the bottom of the left navigation menu.

### 1. upload a document
![docs2](/images/features/docs-upload.png)

First, click the `+ Document` button, then upload PDF files of the various documents you want to send to your customers (e.g. sales materials, proposals, contracts, etc.). 

In the future, we'll be integrating DocuSign, Google Drive, and more to provide a broader document upload experience.

### 2. Create a shared link 

![docs3](/images/features/docs-main.png)
After uploading your documents, you'll need to generate a link to share them with your customers.
Tap the card with the name of the document that you want to create a link for.

![docs4](/images/features/docs-create-link.png)
Tap the `+ Create link` button in the center or top right to generate a document URL to share with your customer.

If you need separate tracking for multiple recipients or groups, you can create multiple shared links in a single PDF document.

You can control the permissions of the document link with a number of useful features, including setting a password, whether to capture emails, allow downloads, and versioning the document.

### 3. Track views and interest 

When you share the URL you created above, the recipient will view the document in a PDF browser viewer. 

While they're reading or browsing your content, Relate Docs works quietly in the background, tracking various engagement metrics.

On the main page, you can see three things
- Total visits: This is the number of visits, including duplicates, which includes multiple views by the same customer.
- Unique visits: The number of visits without duplicates, which includes only one view, even if it was viewed multiple times by the same customer.
- Average duration: The average time that customers viewed the article.

![docs7](/images/features/docs-visits-modal.png)
To view engagement metrics for each link created, click the card for each link. You'll see the following engagement metrics

- Email accounts accessed by document link (when Require email is enabled)
- When accessed per customer 
- Dwell time per slide/page 
- Devices accessed, etc.

If the remaining email accounts are not currently in contacts, you can add them to contacts by clicking the `+` button to the right of the email.

You'll be able to see the email addresses and total time spent on the site, which can be useful for sales decisions. 

With Relate Docs, companies can get a head start on understanding customer engagement and interest, while keeping ownership and control of documents that contain sensitive company information at their fingertips. 

### 4. Use with Forms
![docs8](/images/features/docs-form-routing.png)
If you want to share documents directly to the customer who filled out the form, you can utilize the routing settings in the form.

Documents - Select a specific document URL, and the screen will change so that the document is available immediately upon completion of the form.
