## Overview
Organization is one of the most important concepts in Relate. It's the entity that you're building relationships with and engaging in a deal. An Organization can be a prospect, current customer, lost customer, and/or churned customer. 

[People](/features/people/) and [Deal](/features/deals/) are both part of Organization. A Person can exist without being part of an Organization, but Deal cannot exist without an Organization.

## Concepts

### Organization Detail page

The Organization Detail page collects all information and data linked to the organization you're tracking.

This includes organization data, deals, people, tasks, email history, notes, comments, and activities history.
