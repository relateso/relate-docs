## Task Management

You can use the Task feature to manage a variety of to-dos for sales and customer management.

With Task v1.0, you can manage tasks from the Organization Detail Page (each customer's page). As you can see in the screenshot above, you can see a list of Tasks in the bottom left corner.

In v1.0, you can enter a to-do, assign a responsible person, set a due date, and mark it as complete when you're done.

In future updates, you'll be able to receive reminder notifications.
