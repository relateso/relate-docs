## Overview
Filters lets you add filters to show only the organizations, people, or deals you want to see. Sorters let you sort them in specific order.

For example, you can create a list of organizations that you should follow up on this week. To create this, you can apply a filter `Updated at` + `is after` + `Date`.

## Apply multiple filters and sorters

You can apply multiple filters and sorters to narrow down the list of organizations, people, or deals. For multiple filters and sorters, you can use one of two options:
- `And`: organization/contact that fulfills both Filter A and Filter B.
- `Or`: organization/contact that fulfills at least one of the Filter A and Filter B.

## Customize Columns
