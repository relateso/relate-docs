Windows users might see this warning screen when running Relate. This is because
we haven't notarized our app with Microsoft yet.

For now, you can click `More info` and `Run anyway` to bypass this warning sign and open Relate.

</Accordion>

Once you successfully open Relate, you'll see a log in page. Use the email address and password you signed up with to log in.
