## Overview

Relate's Forms offers an easy way to capture leads, qualify them, and guide them through your sales and marketing workflows. Whether you're building an [inbound sales](https://www.relate.so/docs/wiki/Inbound-Sales) engine or streamlining your marketing efforts, Forms is designed to make the process efficient and effective.

## Basics

Forms helps you identify and manage qualified leads more effectively by using the following components.

### Builder

This is where you design and customize your form structure to suit your needs. Collecting relevant information helps you identify [sales qualified leads (SQLs)](https://www.relate.so/docs/wiki/sql#sales-qualified-lead-sql) and ensure only the most promising leads progress in your [pipeline](https://www.relate.so/docs/features/pipelines).

With the builder, you can:

- Add or remove blocks.
- Edit block labels. Use questions or descriptive labels to collect the information that matters most.
- Use placeholder text to guide user input.
- Set blocks as required or optional.
- Apply custom formats for blocks. To edit block formats, update [custom fields](https://www.relate.so/docs/features/custom-fields) in Settings.

<Note> The input you receive through the form will also be saved in Contact or [Organizations](https://www.relate.so/docs/features/organizations).</Note>


### Routing

Decide where to take your leads based on your workflow needs. Automatically route responses to calendars, documents, or custom URLs to guide them through the next steps in their journey.

- **URL**: Guide leads to tailored pages for further engagement.
- **Meeting**: Direct leads to schedule calls with your team via [Relate Cal](https://www.relate.so/docs/features/calendar).
- **Document**: Provide immediate access to marketing resources like whitepapers or guides using Relate Docs.

For more advanced workflows, you can set up conditional routing. Configure different conditions based on user responses to ensure each lead is directed to the most effective next step in your process.

### Responses

Forms automatically archive submitted information, helping you track leads and monitor progress over time.
