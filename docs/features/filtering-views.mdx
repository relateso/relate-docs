## Filtering and Sorting

![Lead Contact Filtering](/images/features/lead-contact-filtering.png)

\`Filter\` lets you (literally) add filters to your Lead or Contacts list.

For example, you can create a list of leads that you should follow up on this week. To create this, you can apply a filter `Updated at` \+ `is after` \+ `Date`.

### Where are filters and sorting features located?

Filters and Sort features are located on the top right corner of Organization, People, and Deals Pipeline page.

#### Applying Multiple Filters

When applying more than 1 filter, you can apply one of the two conditions: And / Or.

- `And`: Lead/contact that fulfills both Filter A and Filter B.

- `Or`: Lead/contact that fulfills at least one of the Filter A and Filter B.

## Data Views
