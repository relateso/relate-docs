## Overview
[Customer Relationship Management (CRM)](https://www.relate.so/blog/what-is-crm/) is a tool that helps you manage customer data. If you're not familiar with CRM tools, you might not know what customer data you need to manage in CRM. 

While it can vary by customer type, sales process, and product type, one thing that all teams should manage is Expected Close Date.

In this post, we'll talk about what Expected Close Date is and how to manage it.

## What is Expected Close Date?

Based on the information you've learned from talking to customers, you should be able to determine at what point in the future you can successfully close the deal. 

To figure this out, you should ask customers questions about their internal decision-making process and purchasing process. You can use the BANT and MEDDIC frameworks.
