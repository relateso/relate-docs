## Overview

You can automatically enrich customer data in Relate through an integration with Clearbit. This feature automatically adds relevant details, such as company descriptions or job titles, directly to your records whenever you provide key information like a company domain or email address. Every Relate user can enrich up to 250 records per month.

### What is Data Enrichment?

Data enrichment enhances your customer records with additional details sourced from a variety of reliable databases. By integrating data from trusted sources into structured data sets, you can create more comprehensive customer profiles to support your sales and marketing efforts.

## Getting Started

1. At the top left of the Relate app, click the workspace name and select **Manage workspace** to access the [Admin](https://admin.relate.so/) page.
2. Go to **Integrations > Clearbit**.
3. Click `Connect`.
4. Generate your free Clearbit API key.
5. Start enriching your data directly within the Relate app.

## How It Works

You can enrich customer data in several ways within Relate:

New records
- When adding a new [organization](https://www.relate.so/docs/features/organizations) or [contact](https://www.relate.so/docs/features/people#add-a-person), input the company domain or company email address to automatically enrich details such as company descriptions or job titles.

Existing records
