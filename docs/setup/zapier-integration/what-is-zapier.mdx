Zapier is a tool that can easily integrate SaaS applications without coding. It supports 5 free integrations (Zap), and after 5, you can use up to 20 by paying $19.99 per month.

Relate can integrate with 4,000+ applications through Zapier.

Zapier integration has two parts: Trigger and Action.

For example, if a lead is newly created through the Facebook Ad (Trigger), a message is sent to Slack to notify the team members (Action).
