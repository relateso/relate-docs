## Overview

People are part of [Organization](/features/organizations/). "People" in each Organization can be your customers, champions, or any stakeholders that contribute to the buying process.

People *can* exist without an Organization.

## Concepts

### People Grid
The People Grid is a list view of all people records in your Workspace. In the grid, you can update each field by selecting and double clicking (or hitting `Return`) the field.

Clicking `Open` in the People grid will open the Organization linked to that person.

## Add a Person

Click `+Person` button in the People list to add new Person.
