## 1. Integrating with your email

To integrate your email with Relate, go to the [Email Integration](https://admin.relate.so/services) page in the Relate Admin.

![Connect email](/images/setup/connect-email.png)

Click the **Connect** button, enter the email address you want to connect to, and select the email service you use (Google, Office365, Outlook Exchange, and all other services, select Other)

1. If you are using Google Workspace, you will be directed to the Google email link page without selecting an email service. (see screenshot below)

2. If you select Other (e.g., Yahoo, etc.), please follow the 1.1 IMAP/SMTP connection procedure.

Please follow the procedure provided on each email service link page to complete. Then, just follow the **2\. Creating Connections for Each Workspace.**

  ðŸ’¡ If you see a **warning message**, please check if you have registered
  Relate in the allowlist when using Google Workspace email.

### 1.1 IMAP/SMTP Connection

<Warning>
  If you have already connected your email through Google, Outlook, etc., skip
  this step and go to 2\. Create a Connection for Each Workspace.
</Warning>

#### **1.1.1.** Enter your email address/password

Please enter your email address and password to connect as shown below.

#### **1.1.2.** Entering IMAP/SMTP information

IMAP and SMPT host addresses and Port/SSL numbers have unique values for each email service you use. This information is usually on the Admin page, or in the email service customer center/support article.

In this guide, IMAP/SMTP information of NAVER Works is used.

After entering the information, click the **Sign in** button to complete the connection.

If it is changed to **Connected** as shown below on the Relate page, the email linkage is successful. Now, you need to create a Connection so that you can connect the email to each workspace. **2\. Go to Creating Connections for Each Workspace.**

![Email Connect](/images/setup/email-connected.png)

<Note>
  ðŸ’¡ If Two-factor Authentication (2FA or MFA) is currently set in your email
  account, temporarily disable it and complete the procedure.
</Note>

## 2. Creating Connections for Each Workspace

To connect your email service to a new Workspace, select the workspace you want to connect to, and click the **Create Connection** button.

![Creating Connection](/images/setup/creating-connections-workspaces.png)

When a Connection is created, you can see that a Connection has been created in the **Connected users** table as shown below.

![Connected Users](/images/setup/connected-users.png)

Email integration is now complete. Return to the Relate app and register your customers' email address within Lead/contact, and you will see emails sent to and received from that email address.

<Note>
  If you don't see the emails right away, first press Ctrl+Shift+R (Cmd+Shift+R)
  to refresh the Relate app. Depending on the amount of email sent and received,
  this can take anywhere from 5 minutes to up to 8 hours.
</Note>

## 3. Things to note in Email Integration

- If you change your email account password, your email connection will be disconnected. So, you just need to reconnect your email.

- When Two-Factor Authentication (2FA/MFA) is set:
  - **When connecting via MAP/SMTP:**  
    If Two-factor Authentication (2FA/MFA) is set, temporarily disable it before connecting with Relate, and then connect again.
