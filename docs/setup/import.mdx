### Step 1. Gettting started

<Tip>If you already have a .CSV file ready for import, you can skip to Step 2.</Tip>

If you don't you can download a sample .CSV file that already has the default fields as well as sample custom fields like `Linkedin`, `Segment`, and `Tools`.

<Warning>Note that sample custom fields in the sample .CSV file are just *samples*! **You'll need to create your own set of custom fields if you're planning to import additional fields.**</Warning>

Once you have a .CSV file ready to import, proceed to Step 2.

### Step 2. Upload file

Drag and drop a .CSV file or click to choose a file from your local computer.

![import2](/images/setup/import2.png)

Once the files have been added successfully, press `Next Step` at the bottom right corner to proceed.

<Note>Note that by default, first row is a header. If you want to treat the first row as data value, turn this mode off by switching the top left toggle button.</Note>

### Step 3. Match columns

In this step, you can match the columns in your .CSV file with the data fields in Relate.

![import1](/images/setup/import.png)

Note that you can also skip any fields you do not wish to import.

#### Smart fuzzy matching
Input CSV file and destination columns are automatically mapped using smart fuzzy text matching.

#### Fix validation issues seamlessly
If any fields need fixing, you can edit them as if you're editing a spreadsheet directly from the import page. No need to go back to your local Excel file.

If anything goes wrong during this process, error will be displayed in red.

Proceed to next step once you have matched all of the columns.

### Step 4: Import data
Once you click the `Import Data` button you should see a confirmation. Confirm the import and you should be able to see the screen below.

## Importing LinkedIn connections

Relate lets you import your LinkedIn connections. Currently, due to the LinkedIn API environment, there is no automatic way to transfer or sync contact data. 

However, you can export all your contacts at once and then import them into Relate. After that, you can periodically sync the data.

### 1. Export your LinkedIn connections

You can also refer to LinkedIn's [official help documentation](https://www.linkedin.com/help/recruiter/answer/a566336/export-connections-from-linkedin).

To export LinkedIn connections:

1. Click the  **Me** icon at the top of your LinkedIn homepage.
2. Select **Settings & Privacy** from the dropdown.
3. Click **Data privacy** on the left pane.
4. Under the **How LinkedIn uses your data** section, click **Get a copy of your data**.
5. Select **Want something in particular? Select the data files you’re most interested in**.
6. Select **Connections**.
7. Click **Request archive**.
8. Enter your password and click **Done**.
9. You'll receive an email to your **Primary Email address** which will include a link where you can download your list of connections.

**Notes:**
- It might take more than 15-20 minutes to get your download link via email depending on the size of the export.
- **When you’re exporting your connection data, you may notice that some of the email addresses are missing. You will only see email addresses for connections who have allowed their connections to see or download their email address.**
- The CSV and vCard formats don't support all characters. As a result, languages with extended character sets (such as Chinese, Japanese, or Hebrew) aren’t supported.
- You currently can't export a list of your contacts that aren’t 1st-degree connections.

### 2. Import data into Relate

Once you have downloaded your LinkedIn connection data, you can proceed to import them into Relate.

<Warning>
**Make sure to check which workspace you are importing your LinkedIn connections data into.**
</Warning>

1. Go to the [Import data page](https://admin.relate.so/workspaces/import_data) in Relate's Admin Console page.
2. Click **Import LinkedIn with CSV file**
3. Map each field with the corresponding field in Relate (e.g., First Name, Last Name, Company)
4. Complete the Import process.
5. Check your [Relate app](https://app.relate.so/) to see the imported contacts

### Check whether your import is successful
Go to your [workspace](https://web.relate.so/) and check whether your import is successful. Sometimes, you might need to revert -- while we do not have a self-revert feature, feel free to reach out to our team via messenger located on the bottom left corner of the app.
