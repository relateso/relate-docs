## Overview

Relate Engage is a simple email automation tool designed for B2B startups. It allows you to create customized email sequences tailored to your customers or prospects and automatically send follow-up emails at scheduled intervals. The beta version is now available to all Relate users, and paid users can add more sequences to communicate and follow up with various customers more effectively.

## Relate Engage Beta

The Relate Engage Beta is specifically designed for targeted outbound sales and marketing. It is particularly useful in the following cases:

- Sending follow-up emails to customers with ongoing deals.
- Scheduling follow-ups with inbound leads who have shown interest.


## Set Up an Email Sequence

1. Enter the **Engage (beta)** tab from the left panel.

2. Click `+Sequence`, enter a Sequence name and Timezone, then click `Create`.
3. Click `Add a step` to set up a new email. You can configure the following options for a more effective sequence:
   - Assign a sender for the email.
   - Use a pre-built template.
   - Schedule when the first email should be sent after adding a [Contact](../features/people#add-a-person).

4. Add follow-up emails. From the second step onward, you can specify the delay before the next email is sent, ensuring follow-ups are automatically scheduled after a set interval.

    <Note>
    - If you don’t enter a subject line, the follow-up email will be sent in the same thread with "Re:" automatically added to the subject.
    - If you enter a subject line, the email will start a new thread.
    </Note>

### Use Variables

Variables (also known as mail merge fields) allow you to personalize emails dynamically.

![mail-merge](/images/features/mail-merge.png)

- `{{full_name}}`: Full name (First and last names will be separated in a future update.)
- `{{title}}`: Job title
- `{{email}}`: Contact’s email
- `{{phone}}`: Contact’s phone number
- `{{organization}}`: Company name
- `{{domain}}`: Company website URL
- `{{sender_name}}`: Sender’s name
- `{{sender_email}}`: Sender’s email
- `{{now_day}}`: Today's date (e.g., "15" for November 15)
- `{{now_month}}`: Current month (e.g., November)
- `{{now_year}}`: Current year (e.g., 2025)
- `{{now_weekday}}`: Day of the week (e.g., Wednesday)
- `{{number_of_contacts}`: Number of contacts in the organization

### Track Email Performance
You can track the results of your email sequences in the list of **Sequences**, where you can monitor open rates, click rates, replies, and bounce rates. For detailed recipient-level tracking, go to the **Recipients** tab.

Even if a recipient is included in a sequence, emails will not be sent in the following cases:

- The recipient has unsubscribed.
- The email has bounced:
   - Soft bounce: A temporary issue, such as a full inbox or an unavailable mail server.
    - Hard bounce: A permanent issue, such as an invalid or non-existent email address.

The following features are planned for future updates:
- Easily add filtered lists from the **Organizations** or **People** to sequences.
- Preview emails before they are sent.
- Track how many times each recipient has opened or clicked an email.
