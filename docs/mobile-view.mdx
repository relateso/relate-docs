## Overview
Relate is available on mobile as well as desktop via a progressive web app (PWA).
You can access Relate from any smart device (iOS, Android) to view and manage your customer and sales data anytime, anywhere.

The behavior is the same as the desktop & web app. We've just adapted the interface to support mobile.
You can search for customer information, view and edit deal and note information, and use the same comment and mention.

## How to get started
![mobile-view 2](/images/setup/mobileview-share.png)
First, access Relate in your browser (Chrome, Safari, etc.).
On the first screen where you are not logged in, press the `Share` or `...` button.

Next, select “Add to home screen” from the sharing options.
As a final step, you'll be taken to a screen where you can set a name for Relate. It's named **Relate** by default, so click the Add button.

After finalizing the above steps, you should see a mobile view shortcut created on your home screen with Relate's logo.
Tap the shortcut icon to log in and you'll be able to use it just like the mobile app.
