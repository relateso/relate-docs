## Organizations

Relate lets you build all your communication history for each organization you work with in one place.

The Organizations feature collects your Deals, Email history, Notes, etc. and displays them in one view.

<Info>

Get to know Relate's structure

- Organization = Companies you are selling to. They can be both prospects and customers

- Person = People that work for the companies you're selling to.
- Deal = Sales opportunity

</Info>

People and Deal are both part of an Organization. A Person can exist without being part of an Organization, but Deal cannot exist without an Organization.

## Adding a new Organization

  When you're creating a new Organization, you can also create a Person. Click
  `Add contact data` located at the bottom of the modal.

## Organization Detail Page

The Organization detail page collects all your communication history, deal history, and contact information in one view.

### Organization Detail

On the right side, you can see two things -- (1) notes (e.g., updates, meeting notes, etc.), (2) email history with the Organization (people).

Use the commenting section to communicate internally with your teammates.

## Creating a note

One of the best and easiest ways to improve your sales is always keeping your customer information up-to-date. This means that you should always be writing meeting notes and status updates!

There are four types of Notes in Relate:

- **Meeting Note**
- **Phone Call Note**
- **Zoom Call Note**
- **Other Note** -- used when you have a status update and/or additional information to share with your team.

The Notes feature supports Markdown syntax as well.

![link-sharing](/images/features/link-sharing.png)

Click `Share` button on the top right corner of a note, then switch the toggle on. Then, click `Copy link` to copy a shareable link.

The shared note looks like this on the web (see above).

### Share notes via Slack

You can use [Zapier](/setup/zapier-integration/what-is-zapier) (free account) to set up an automation where Relate will share new notes via Slack.

![slack](/images/features/slack-integration.png)

At Relate, we have a `#log-sales` Slack channel connected to Relate. Whenever there's a new note in Relate, this channel will share that immediately.
