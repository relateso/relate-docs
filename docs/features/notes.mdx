## Overview
Create, edit, and share notes with your team for each Organization. 

Use the notes to capture information such as BANT, MEDDIC, and/or Relate Notes.

You can also create templates to format your notes automatically.

## Basics
One of the best and easiest ways to improve your sales is always writing notes after each sales call.

Notes in Relate supports markdown syntax and you can also use WYSIWYG styling button located at the top of each draft.

### Creating a note
To create a note, go to an Organization detail page. Then, click `Create note` to open new draft.

<Warning>Currently notes do NOT save as a draft.</Warning>

### Templates
To use a template for repeat formats, hit `Use template` after opening a new draft.

Relate has three prebuilt templates - Default, [BANT](https://www.relate.so/blog/what-is-bant/), and [MEDDIC](https://www.relate.so/blog/what-is-meddic/).

You can create a new template by clicking `+ Add a new template`.

### Share notes via Slack

You can use [Zapier](/setup/zapier-integration/what-is-zapier) (free account) to set up an automation where Relate will share new notes via Slack.

For example, at Relate, we have a `#log-sales` Slack channel connected to Relate. Relate will send a copy to that channel whenever there's a new note.
