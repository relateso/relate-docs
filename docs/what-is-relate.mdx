## Introducing an entirely new CRM -- Relate
Relate is a *new* sales CRM designed to work out of the box -- without extensive customization or hiring implementation consultants.

Relate also has a unique approach to B2B sales that we follow on our own team. This approach works end-to-end -- from prospecting to maintaining healthy customer relationships.

With Relate, you can track all your ongoing sales activities in one place, such as deals, customer emails, and much more.

## Our goal is to make go-to-market simple.
Our goal is to make go-to-market simple and easy for B2B companies.

We've built many SaaS products and tried to go to market with them before. In our effort, we struggled to use a proper CRM because existing solutions were clunky, slow, and expensive if you buy higher-tier plans.

Relate was inspired by our *own* needs here at Relate team. We build software that we want to use ourselves.
