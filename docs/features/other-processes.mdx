## Overview
Process can be used for a variety of tasks that have a series of steps, not just sales.
We provide templates for Fundraising and Recruiting, among others, which have a similar flow to sales.

<Note>
    You can learn more about using processes in [Processes](/features/processes).
</Note>

<Info>
    If you want to change the status and custom fields provided by this template,
    
    you can find instructions in [Processes > 3. Setting up the process](/features/processes#3-setting-up-the-process) and the [Custom Fields Guide](/features/custom-fields).
</Info>

## Fundraising process
![other 02](/images/features/other-fundraising.png)

Because investments are often made at the investment company level rather than at the individual level, the [entry](/features/processes#1-entry) type is fixed to organization.
We provide status as the process of how the investment came to fruition, and we provide custom fields for information beyond the company.

First, Status provides eight steps.
- Active: Lead, Intro, First meeting, Pitch, Committed, Due diligence
- Won: Funded
- Lost: Passed

Three custom fields are available: Investor type, Fit, and Memo, and you can also add the information you need via Settings > Processes > Custom fields.
- Investor type (Select): Angel, VC, Accelerator, CVC
- Fit (Select): Good, Neutral, Bad
- Memo (multiple text)

## Recruiting process
![other 03](/images/features/other-recruiting.png)

Because talent acquisition is a human activity, the [entry](/features/processes#1-entry) type is fixed to contact.
You can also provide the status of the talent acquisition as status, and you can manage the team that's currently hiring and the hiring manager in custom fields.

Status provides seven steps.
- Active: New, Screening, Interviewing, Sent offer
- Won: Accepted
- Lost: Rejected, Dropped

Two custom fields are available: Recruiting team and Hiring manager, which can be customized to fit your company's environment via Settings > Processes > Custom fields.
