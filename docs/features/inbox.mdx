## Overview

![Inbox](/images/features/inbox.png)

Relate isn't just a customer database. It's also a customer communications hub -- any email your customers send you lands on your Inbox in Relate.

With Inbox, you can manage your customer communication without missing anything.

- Emails (Both sent & received from a contact)

- Comments from the team

- Notes created by the team

You can use the Inbox as a to-do list since you can get all customer updates here. You can leave items that require additional action in the Inbox. Then, once you're done with them, you can select `Archive` to move them to the Archive tab. You can also `Star` them to pin important items.

### Private Comments on Emails

You can write internal comments on the email threads. These comments are only shared internally and are not included in emails that you send.

<Accordion defaultOpen="false" title="Which emails can be seen in Relate?">

Relate pulls any email threads that you sent to/received from your registered contact.

Not all emails can be accessed via Relate. Only the emails registered as contact's email in Relate can be accessed.

</Accordion>

<Note> **Some emails are not syncing. What should I do?**

If you registered a customer email in Relate but some emails are still not synced, follow below to troubleshoot.

1. Most emails are synced almost instantly, but it can take up to 8 hours maximum depending on the time email was sent.
2. Check whether your email is [integrated to Relate](/setup/email-integration-google-outlook-etc)
3. Have you changed your email account's password? If so, follow [this guide](/setup/email-integration-google-outlook-etc) to reauthenticate your email.
4. Try refreshing your app (`Cmd+Shift+R`)

## Note to Inbox/Commenting

If you leave a [Note](/features/organizations#creating-a-note) in Relate, all other members in your workspace will get a new item in their Inboxes.

Just like you can write private comments to email threads, you can write comments to any notes in the Inbox.

<Note>
  Currently, any @mentions will notify **everyone** in your workspace.
