Person:

- **Person Name (Required)**

## How to import

### Step 1. Gettting started

<Tip>If you already have a .CSV file ready for import, you can skip to Step 2.</Tip>

If you don't you can download a sample .CSV file that already has the default fields as well as sample custom fields like `Linkedin`, `Segment`, and `Tools`.

<Warning>Note that sample custom fields in the sample .CSV file are just *samples*! **You'll need to create your own set of custom fields if you're planning to import additional fields.**</Warning>

Once you have a .CSV file ready to import, proceed to Step 2.

### Step 2. Upload file

Drag and drop a .CSV file or click to choose a file from your local computer.

Once the files have been added successfully, press `Next Step` at the bottom right corner to proceed.

<Note>Note that by default, first row is a header. If you want to treat the first row as data value, turn this mode off by switching the top left toggle button.</Note>

### Step 3. Match columns

In this step, you can match the columns in your .CSV file with the data fields in Relate.

![import1](/images/setup/import.png)

Note that you can also skip any fields you do not wish to import.

#### Smart fuzzy matching
Input CSV file and destination columns are automatically mapped using smart fuzzy text matching.

#### Fix validation issues seamlessly
If any fields need fixing, you can edit them as if you're editing a spreadsheet directly from the import page. No need to go back to your local Excel file.

If anything goes wrong during this process, error will be displayed in red.

Proceed to next step once you have matched all of the columns.

### Step 4: Import data
Once you click the `Import Data` button you should see a confirmation. Confirm the import and you should be able to see the screen below.
